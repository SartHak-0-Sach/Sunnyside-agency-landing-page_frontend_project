## Overview

### The Challenge

Experience the vibrant and dynamic world of marketing and brand enhancement with the Sunnyside Agency landing page. Discover innovative solutions to elevate your brand's social presence and expand its reach.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My Process

### Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

You will find all the required assets in the `/design` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

### What I Learned

- Implementing engaging hover states for interactive elements
- Creating an inviting and immersive user experience with vibrant design elements
- Enhancing accessibility and usability with clear navigation and layout

This project helps bring forward the inner developer in you by allowing creative ways to implement different features using variety of tech stacks. Following is one such example of code snippet of using event listeners in JavaScript to implement one such element as shown-

```js
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
    const downIcon = document.querySelector(".down-icon");
    const mainSection = document.querySelector("main");

    downIcon.addEventListener("click", function () {
        mainSection.scrollIntoView({
            behavior: "smooth",
            block: "start"
        });
    });
});
```

### Continued development

The continuously learning journey of a programmer never ends. This project made me realize that there are many concepts that I need to work upon including fundamentals like flex-box and its properties, to more complex concepts like working with fetch and async await in javascript. These areas are some that I think I need to work more upon in the upcoming future as they highlight some of the most significant regions of web development that are important for every developer to know of. 

These key points mentioned here will help me grow accountable and consistent towards improving at writing good quality code and be a successful full stack developer one day.

### Useful resources
